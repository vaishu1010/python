# python :
The python is interperted language ,object oriented ,high level programming langauge with dynamic semantic.
* Python is case sensitive 
* python is used for:
  . web  develpment 
  . software development 
  . mathematices
  . system scripting
* Python runs on the interpreted system meanings that code can be executed as soon written.
* This means  that protectyping very quicky.
* pyhton can be treated in a procedual way an object oriented way or function way.
 
Statement:

* Instruction that you written in code and python interpreted can be excuited are called statement.


keywords :

* keywords are the reserved words in python.These reserved words cannot be used as function name variables names or any other identifies .

t
Statements :

* Instruction that you write in code and that a python interpreter can execute are callled statements.


Comments:

* Comments are nothing but the sentences that the python interpreter the python interpreter ignores.


Indentation :

*Indentation in python refers to the (spaces and tabs) that are used at the beginning of statement or code we write.

## Data types :
1. integer
2. float
3. complex
4. string
5. list
6. tuple
7. set
8. dictionary
9. boolen
10. range


* Dynamic and static Typing:

In python , variables are the reserved memeory location to store values. Python is a dynamically typed language which is not required to mention the type of variables while declaring. it performed the type checking at run time .
In statically typed programing languages which is required to mention the type of variables while declaring. it perform the type checking at compile time.





* Input and output:


Until now the values were defined to the variables. In some cases user might want to input values to variables which allow flexiblility.


* Operators :

## Arithimatic operator :
1. addition(+)
2. substraction(-)
3. multiplication( * )
4. Divivsion (/)
5. floor division(//)
6. Modules(%)
7. Exponent(**)

## Relational operator:
1. Greater than (>)
2. less than (<)
3. Equal to (==)
4. not equal to (!=)
5. Greater then equal to (>=)
6. less than equal to(<=)

## Assignement operator:
1. assign(=)
2. add and asign(+=)
3. sub and assign(-=)
4. multiple and assign(*=)
5. divide and assign(/=)
6. floor divide and assign(//=)
7. modules and assign(%=)
8. exponent and assign(**=)


## Logical operator:
1. and : The logical operator return True if both expression are True.
2. or: The logical or the operator returns as boolen True if one expression is True 
3. not: The logical not operator return as boolen True if the expression is false.



## Membership operator:
In the python ,there are two membership operator in and not in


## Identity operator:
use the identity operator to check whether the the value of two variables is the same or not .

## Bitwise:
1. & Bitwise and 
2. | Bitwise or
3. ^ Bitwise xor



## Numeric Types:
The numeric type data in python is generally in three formats namely integer, float,complex.

We can create the an integer variables using the two ways:
1. Directly assigning an integer values to a variables
2. using a int()class.

## Type casting :

Implicit type convension : compatibles data type are in the general two numeric data types like int and float . it will convert the smaller the data type to larger one to prevent  any data loss. for eg: in data will the be converted to float.

Explicit Type conversion:
In emplicit type conversion
